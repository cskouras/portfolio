  <h1> Introduction </h1>
  <p> I'm a student at a middle and high school in Florida. I love to play many sports, and I also enjoy watching them on TV. My favorite color is blue, as you can probably tell from my website design!
  </p>
  <p> In addition to sports, I love books, good food, snow, dogs, and a lot more! I dislike many vegetables, and very hot days, but not much else. My family consists of my parents, my sister, and our rescue dog, Evie. </p>

  <h1> Where I'm From </h1>
  <p> I was born and raised in Manhattan. When I was twelve years old, I moved to Florida with my family. I miss New York City, but Florida's cool too, except for the hot weather. But my favorite place of all time is Long Island, New York. The picture above of me and my dog was taken last year in Long Island. </p>

  <h1> More About Me </h1>
  <h2> What are your favorite hobbies? </h2>
  <p> Some of my  favorite sports include lacrosse, tennis, golf, swimming, running, biking, and paddleboarding. I'm on the swim team and the lacrosse team at my school, and I do the other listed sports with my dad. </p>
  <h2> What's your dream job? </h2>
  <p> I don't really have a dream job, but I do love animals, epecially dogs, as well as math and French. The hard part is combining all of those things into one job...  </p> 
  <h2> What's your background? </h2>
  <p> I don't have much of a background; I guess fourteen years isn't enough time to develop one! When I lived in New York, I danced a lot of ballet, but once I moved to Miami, most of my activities outside of school became sports related. </p>
  <h2> What music have you been listening to lately? </h2>
  <p> I don't really listen to much music. the main time that I listen to music is on the car radio. I usually just listen to whatever my dad puts on the radio, which, if I'm lucky, isn't the news but actual music. </p>
